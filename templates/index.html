    <p class="text-white mt-5">Whether it’s selling invasive surveillance technology, partnering with police, or creating the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/10/22/139639/amazon-is-the-invisible-backbone-behind-ices-immigration-crackdown/">backbone</a> infrastructure for mass deportations, Amazon is central to militarized policing. Its practices allow racist policing to be more efficient, expanding the criminalization of Black and brown people and creating more opportunities for repressive police violence. This needs to stop. Help us shut down Amazon’s surveillance-powered police state. </p>

    <p class="text-alt">Amazon creates <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141336/amazon-ring-cameras-spy-neighbors-police-nbc-news-intelligencer">dangerous</a> surveillance technology and partnerships that enable mass scale policing designed to monitor everyone, everywhere, at all times. Amazon’s vast surveillance network coupled with it’s racially <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywaa57/how-ring-transmits-fear-to-american-suburbs">coded</a> marketing creates a neighborhood-to-prison pipeline. This represents dramatic high-tech expansion of racial profiling and criminalization. By embedding itself as an extension of law enforcement, Amazon profits from the detention, deportation, and mass incarceration of Black and brown people.</p>

        <p>For years, Amazon marketed its dangerous facial recognition software, Rekognition, to its police partners. Amazon knew police were using this technology <a href="https://www.perpetuallineup.org/">incorrectly and without public oversight</a>, and they knew that Rekognition disproportionately misidentifies <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/03/amazon-police-racism-tech-black-lives-matter/">Black and brown people</a>, <a href="https://qz.com/1726806/facial-recognition-ai-from-amazon-microsoft-and-ibm-misidentifies-trans-and-non-binary-people/">transgender people</a>, and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/study-finds-gender-skin-type-bias-artificial-intelligence-systems-0212">women</a>—but, they refused to stop. </p>
        <p class="mb-0">After intense pressure on Amazon and nationwide protests against police violence, last summer Amazon announced a one year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/">moratorium</a> on police using Rekognition. With the one year moratorium coming to an end, Amazon has not said a word—despite widespread calls to defund the police and ban facial recognition.</p>

Their cloud computing software streamlines detentions, deportations, family separations, and the Orwellian collection of immigrants’ biometric data—including their faces, fingerprints, and iris scans. Now, the technology giant is helping <a href="https://justfutureslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/HART-Appropriations-2022.pdf">construct</a> a $4.3 billion dollar biometrics database that would track and identify millions of immigrants and US citizens in real time. This will supercharge policing of immigrants and their families by connecting biometrics databases across federal agencies and granting access to police departments. </p>
